# Sport-Celebrity-Facial-Recognition

We aim to build a facial recognition model in Python

We will have a dataset with various images from multiple celebrities

We will determine which image contains two eyes and additionally the boundary of the face

Further, upon discovery, we will program a system to generate a folder within our working directory to store the cropped image of the recognized celebrity's face.
